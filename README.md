# geisterr-usage-statistics

This repository contains a [notebook](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/geisterr-usage-statistics/blob/main/plot.ipynb) for plotting usage-statistics of the Geisterr software. The software itself was never published in a Journal, nor its source code. 
Scientific results produced using the software are published in:
